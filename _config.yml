  "I love solving complex problems with data!"
  <br><br>
  As a quality control professional in the pharmaceutical industry, digging into data, understanding complex systems, and breaking it down into valuable insights were at the core of my work.
  After I switched into the tech industry, I got excited about the endless possibilities of Data Science and decided to follow this passion. I am enthusiastic about learning, and currently, I am completing a data science immersive program at General Assembly.
